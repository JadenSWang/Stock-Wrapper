### Getting Started
Complete example is under Examples/example.py

Most of the data manipulation is based off the <stock_wrapper.Stock> object. 

##### We will be using the S&P 500 Index as an example
> from stock_wrapper import Stock 
>
> snp = Stock('SPY')

##### Stock_Wrapper 
> high_price = snp.high
>
> low_price = snp.low

Other properties include open, close, ceo, history, etc.

##### Visualization
> from stock_wrapper import visualize
> from stock_wrapper import Stock

Place your stock object inside brackets, as of now, visualization methods take in a list of Stock objects

> snp = Stock('SPY')
>
> visualize.graph_trendline_analysis([snp])
>
> visualize.graph_candlestick_analysis([snp])

The graphing might take a couple seconds since it's loading years and years of data and calculating various moving averages

If you want to graph multiple stocks, its best to group them like so as this streamlines the data loading process
> microsoft = Stock('MSFT')
>
> visualize.graph_trendline_analysis([snp, microsoft])
